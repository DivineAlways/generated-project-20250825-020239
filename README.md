# Vet Shop Website Project

## Overview

This project contains all the files for a simple, modern, and user-friendly website for an animal veterinary shop. The goal is to provide essential information to pet owners and allow them to easily request appointments.

## How to Use

This package is self-contained. No build process or external dependencies are required for the prototype.

1.  **Start Here**: Open `index.html` in your web browser. This is the main project hub.
2.  **Explore**: From the hub, you can navigate to:
    *   **Documentation (`/docs`)**: Read the project's planning documents.
    *   **Wireframes (`/wireframes`)**: View the low-fidelity layouts.
    *   **Interactive Prototype (`/prototype`)**: Experience the final, clickable website.
