## Flow 1: New Client Requests an Appointment

This is the most critical user journey, converting a visitor into a potential client.

**Actor:** A new pet owner searching for a local vet.

**Goal:** To learn about the clinic and request a first-time appointment for their pet.

**Steps:**

1.  **Arrival:** The user lands on the **Homepage**, likely from a search engine.
2.  **First Impression:** The user reads the mission statement and sees the welcoming hero image.
3.  **Exploration (Optional):**
    *   The user clicks on the **"Services"** link in the navigation to see if the clinic offers the care they need (e.g., puppy vaccinations).
    *   The user clicks on the **"Our Team"** link to read about the veterinarians to ensure they are qualified and seem trustworthy.
4.  **Initiate Contact:** The user is convinced and clicks the **"Book Appointment"** button (either from the homepage CTA or the main navigation, which both lead to the Contact page).
5.  **Form Submission:** The user lands on the **Contact Page**.
    *   They fill out the appointment request form with their details: name, contact info, pet's name, and a brief reason for the visit.
    *   They click the **"Submit Request"** button.
6.  **Confirmation:** The user sees an on-screen confirmation message acknowledging that their request has been received and that the clinic will call them back to confirm the appointment details.
7.  **Completion:** The user's primary goal is complete. They close the website, awaiting a call from the clinic.
